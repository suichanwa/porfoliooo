# Security Vulnerabilities Fix

## Issue Description
The project has 7 security vulnerabilities identified by npm audit, including critical XSS and CSRF vulnerabilities in Astro, and other moderate to high severity issues.

## Vulnerability Details
```
astro  <=5.3.1
Severity: high
- DOM Clobbering Gadget found in astro's client-side router that leads to XSS
- Astro CSRF Middleware Bypass (security.checkOrigin)
- Astro's server source code is exposed to the public if sourcemaps are enabled

esbuild  <=0.24.2
Severity: moderate
- esbuild enables any website to send any requests to the development server

cookie  <0.7.0
- cookie accepts cookie name, path, and domain with out of bounds characters

tar-fs  2.0.0 - 2.1.2 || 3.0.0 - 3.0.8
Severity: high
- tar-fs can extract outside the specified dir with a specific tarball

brace-expansion  2.0.0 - 2.0.1
- Regular Expression Denial of Service vulnerability
```

## Impact
- XSS vulnerabilities could allow malicious code execution
- CSRF bypass could allow unauthorized actions
- Path traversal could lead to file system access
- Development server could be compromised

## Solution
1. Update vulnerable packages to secure versions
2. Review and update dependencies regularly
3. Add npm audit to CI/CD pipeline

## Commands to Fix
```bash
# First, try automatic fixes
npm audit fix

# For breaking changes that require manual review
npm audit fix --force

# Verify fixes
npm audit
```

## Files to Modify
- `package.json` - Update dependency versions
- `package-lock.json` - Will be updated automatically
- Add npm audit check to CI workflow

## Testing
- Run `npm audit` to verify no vulnerabilities remain
- Test application functionality after updates
- Ensure build process still works correctly

## Priority: HIGH
This should be addressed immediately due to security implications.
