Today I decided to create this developer diary as part of my portfolio site.
I've been wanting to document my journey for a while now, and this feels like the perfect way to do it.

## Why keep a developer diary?

There are a few reasons I think keeping a developer diary is valuable:

- It creates a record of my growth and learning over time
- Writing helps me process what I've learned and solidify my understanding
- It shows potential employers or clients my thought process and personality
- It forces me to reflect on my progress regularly
