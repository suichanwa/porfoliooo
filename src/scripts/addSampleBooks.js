    title: "Clean Code",
    author: "Robert C. Martin",
    description: "A handbook of agile software craftsmanship",
    genre: "Programming",
    year: 2008,
    pages: 464,
    myThoughts: `This book completely changed how I think about writing code. Martin's emphasis on 
readability and maintainability resonates deeply with me. The examples are practical 
and the principles are timeless.

Key takeaways:
- Code should be readable like prose
- Functions should be small and do one thing
- Comments should explain why, not what

Would definitely recommend to any developer looking to level up their craft.`,

    title: "JavaScript: The Good Parts",
    author: "Douglas Crockford",
    description: "Unearthing the Excellence in JavaScript",
    genre: "Programming",
    year: 2008,
    pages: 176,
    myThoughts: `Short but powerful. Crockford's insights into JavaScript helped me understand
the language on a deeper level. Some parts feel outdated now with ES6+, but
the core principles about avoiding the bad parts still hold true.

Essential read for any JavaScript developer who wants to write better code.`,

    genre: "Programming",
    year: 1994,
    pages: 395,
    myThoughts: `A classic that every developer should read at least once. While some patterns 
feel dated in modern JavaScript/TypeScript, the core concepts are invaluable.

The Observer and Factory patterns have been particularly useful in my React projects.`,
